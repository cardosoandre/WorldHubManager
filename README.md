# 3D World Sphere Level Selector
Whenever I have some free time I decide to practice something new in Unity, and one the results of that was me recreating the *"Level Select"* of **Super Mario Odyssey**! I ended up liking the result, so I posted it on reddit ([you can check out the post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/8fkvx6/recreated_the_stage_select_system_from_super/)) and the response was awesome! A lot of people were interested trying it out and asked me to share my code, so I found that to be a great opportunity to build and share a more organized/documented code in order to make the code more accessible!

## General
The **3d World Sphere Level Selector** project was built to make it quick and easy to position 3d points in sphere coordinates and make the game "look" at that specific point. 

The whole code is carefully documented so anyone can fully understand how it works! But if you have any questions just hit me up!

## Editing
The whole project works with only one script, all you have to do is edit the *List of World Points* in the **World Manager** script on the inspector.

## Visualisation
The project is filled with Gizmos and sliders so that it's more intuitive to make changes to the world positions in real-time!

## "Look" Modes

I've even implemented different behaviours for how the World Point is viewed!

| Just Sphere Look|Just Camera Look|Sphere and Camera Look|

## Instructions

All you need to do is load the *MainScene* of the project and everything is there nice and clean! The most important thing is the *WorldManager* script and the object hierarchy I used on my scene!
